					</div><br>
					<p><img src="images/luster_class.png"> Luster is the fourth and final <span data-translate="scion">scion</span> class released for PSO2. It requires you to have two classes at 75+, and unlocks the ability to become a Luster on any character. Like Phantom and Etoile, it cannot take a subclass, but it can be used as a subclass. It uses <img src="images/gunblade.png"><span data-translate="Gunblades">Gunblades</span>, <img src="images/gunblade.png"><span data-translate="Gunblades">Gunblades</span>, and <img src="images/gunblade.png"><span data-translate="Gunblades">Gunblades</span> as it's main weapons (Noticing a pattern?). It is an inherently agressive class with it's own unique mechanic, and a bit complicated and different from the other classes. Because of this, we'll need to do a bit of explaining first.</p>
					
					<p>There are three different "styles" for Luster, named after the compound techniques. Each style bring various differences including the color/element of the attacks, your focus meter, the actions you can use, and more. The style you use depends on what element the <span data-translate="Gunblade">Gunblade</span> you have equipped is.<br><br>
					<img src="images/LU_Fomel.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Fomel Style (Fire/Dark):</b> This style is designed for bosses and single targets. <br>
					<img src="images/LU_Baran.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Baran Style (Light/Ice):</b> This style is designed for defense. <br>
					<img src="images/LU_Zandi.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Zandi Style (Wind/Lightning):</b> This style is designed for AOE and mobbing.<br>
					<br>
					If you have trouble remembering which is which:<br>
					<b>Fo</b>mel (<b>Fo</b>ie, Fire tech)<br>
					<b>Ba</b>ran (<b>Ba</b>rta, Ice tech)<br>
					<b>Zan</b>di (<b>Zan</b>verse, Wind tech)<br>
					<br>
					If you only have one <span data-translate="Gunblade">Gunblade</span> and literally can't get any others, Fomel would be the one style you use because it's DPS is higher then the others. <i>However</i>, it is highly recommended to do 3 styles, as each has their own unique uses.<br>
					<p>Before we take a look at the styles, we need to go over some terminology for Luster.</p>

					</div><br>
					<b>Voltage:</b> Voltage is an additional gauge for Luster, next to the <span data-translate="focus">focus</span> gauge. Every time you hit an enemy (including mag attacks), the meter rises. As it rises, it increases both the damage you deal and your defense against incoming damage (0.02% damage increase per <span data-translate="voltage">voltage</span>, 0.04% damage reduction per <span data-translate="voltage">voltage</span>). As your voltage increases, various skills can activate from it. If you don't hit anything for 5 seconds, you lose <b>all Voltage</b>.<br>
					<b><span data-translate="Move Art">Move Art</span>:</b> A <span data-translate="Move Art">Move Art</span> is when you use a PA while holding a direction (Forward/Back/Left/Right or any point inbetween).<br>
					<b><span data-translate="Stay Art">Stay Art</span>:</b> A <span data-translate="Stay Art">Stay Art</span> is when you use a PA without holding any direction.<br>
					<b><span data-translate="Enhance Art">Enhance Art</span>:</b> When you use a PA and hold the PA button, you will do another (new) part of the attack. This is called an <span data-translate="Enhance Art">Enhance Art</span>. It consumes 1 <span data-translate="focus">focus</span> gauge.<br>
					<b><span data-translate="Purge Style">Purge Style</span>:</b> When you doubletap the Weapon Action button, you switch to <span data-translate="Purge Style">Purge Style</span> (A neutral element style) for 10 seconds. While in this state, you gain no quirks (unlike the other styles) except for firing your <span data-translate="Gunblade">Gunblade</span> rapidly when you hold the Weapon Action button. This consumes both gear and PP, as if you were pretending to be a bad Phantom player (This is a callout post). If you hit an enemy with this skill, you gain 3 gear back instantly.<br>
					<b><span data-translate="Quick Slash">Quick Slash</span>:</b> After using a PA (or <span data-translate="Slash Fall">Slash Fall</span>/<span data-translate="Slash Rise">Slash Rise</span>, we'll talk about those in the next section), you may notice a horizontal line glowing on your character. Pressing the normal attack button while it is visible will do a special attack based on the direction you're holding (or lack thereof). Holding a direction will make you lunge in that direction while slashing. Not holding a direction will execute a ranged multiple hit attack.<br>
					<b><span data-translate="Quick Shoot">Quick Shoot</span>:</b> After doing your fourth normal attack (unlocked via the skill tree), you can tap the Weapon Action button to do different things, depending on your chosen style. There are also ways to do it unique to each style, which we'll go over a bit later.<br>
					<b>Photon Cluster:</b> An object that shows up near your body and gives you different beneficial effects. It's also activated differently in each style.<br>
					<p>
					
					<p>Each style has the same basic normal attacks (a fourth normal attack is unlocked via the skill tree) and PAs (with the exception of a ranged attack being added to normal attacks for the Zandi style), though colored in different auras (and using different elements, duh!). If you doubletap the dodge (Doubledodging? Is that a word? It is now.) button, some different things will happen if you're locked onto an enemy. Doubledodging forward will slash the air repeatedly around you, doubledodging backwards will shoot homing lasers. Doubledodging to either side will do the Apex Legends slide while shooting photon bullets.</p>
					
					<p>The <span data-translate="Non-element">non-element</span> skill makes it so that the element type of your weapon does not affect your damage - it only determines what style you use. This means you don't have to worry about using Fomel style against a Light weak boss, for example.</p>
					
					<p>Tapping the weapon action is also the same in each style, it simply shoots or dodges and shoots if you're holding a direction. Doubletapping the Weapon Action button will execute the <span data-translate="Purge Style">Purge Style</span> skill and put you into the <span data-translate="Non-element">non-element</span> state. Additionally, jumping after an attack while holding a direction will use <span data-translate="Slash Rise">Slash Rise</span>, a 10 PP costing attack that moves you up a bit. Jumping after an attack while not holding a direction will use <span data-translate="Slash Fall">Slash Fall</span>, which slams you into the ground (and is weaker if you're already on the ground). For both of these, if you hold jump, you will cast an uncharged Zanverse at the end (or Megiverse if your HP is under 75%!).</p>

					<p>Let's take a look at the different styles, along with what they do!</p><br>
					<div class="mr-auto w-50">
						<h3 class="boldtitlelarge mr-auto"><a id="styles"></a>Styles</span></h3>
					</div><br>
					
					<!-- Video showing different styles here -->
					<p><img src="images/LU_Fomel.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Fomel Style (Fire/Dark)</b>: Voltage charges faster by using the skills mentioned here. Holding the normal attack button summons 3 Photon Spears that will damage enemies and cast Jellen (attack debuff) on them when you use Photon Arts (up to 3 times). Very useful if you have Phrase Decay (enemy takes more damage if they have Jellen on them). Holding the Weapon Action button will stab the enemy repeatedly ala Stinger from DMC and follow it up with a final thrust. The damage, duration, and distance of the final thrust is dependent on how long you hold it and how much <span data-translate="focus">focus</span> you use.</p>
					
					<p>Fomel style's Photon Cluster is activated by doing two different Photon Arts back to back, but doing the second one the moment the <span data-translate="Perfect Attack">Perfect Attack</span> window appears. This surrounds you with... <strike>things</strike> <strike>blades</strike> <strike>photons</strike> bits from Gundam that do damage in an AOE and restore 5 PP with each hit.</p>
					
					<p>Fomel's <span data-translate="Quick Shoot">Quick Shoot</span> is activated by doing an Enhanced Combo - two Enhanced Arts back to back (while performing an enhanced art, press the PA button again when you have a <span data-translate="focus">focus</span> gauge) - followed by pressing Weapon Action after a minor delay. It jumps you towards your enemy while slamming them with your Gunblade, like the Stinger move from Devil May Cry.</p>

					</div><br>
					
					<img src="images/LU_Baran.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Baran Style (Light/Ice)</b>: Voltage charges faster by using <span data-translate="Stay Art">Stay Art</span>s in this style. Normal attacks (aside from step attacks) and <span data-translate="Stay Art">Stay Art</span>s have guard frames at the start. Holding the normal attack button generates an AOE that deals damage with paper airplanes. Holding the Weapon Action button will charge a photon bullet that does a large amount of damage. Holding down the Weapon Action button will do more damage, consuming more <span data-translate="focus">focus</span> in the process.</p>
					
					<p>Baran style's Photon Cluster is activated by performing a Just Guard (guarding the moment an attack is about to hit you). Keep in mind that this means attacking using a Normal Attack or <span data-translate="Stay Art">Stay Art</span>s, since those are how this class guards. This surrounds you with metal mario shield bits from Gundam 00 and decreases your damage taken by 25%.</p>
					
					<p>Baran's <span data-translate="Quick Shoot">Quick Shoot</span> is activated by doing a counter, then using your Weapon Action after a slight delay. It fires a very quick shot of ice that has a long range.</p>
					<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SX2Q8wjfsdw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</div><br>
					
					<img src="images/LU_Zandi.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Zandi Style (Wind/Lightning)</b>: <p>Voltage charges faster by using <span data-translate="Move Art">Move Art</span>s. Hold the Normal Attack button to generate an AOE pull-in (a la Zondeel). Holding the Weapon Action button casts an AOE field that damages all enemies in it on release. Holding down the Weapon Action button will make it bigger (up to 2 times), consuming more <span data-translate="focus">focus</span> in the process.</p>
					
					<p>Zandi style's Photon Cluster is activated by dodging an attack with a sideways dodge or with the Weapon Action. This, like redbull, gives you wings and lets you fire bolts from the space above you after hitting an enemy with a PA, dealing damage and restoring 5 PP.</p>
					
					<p>Zandi's <span data-translate="Quick Shoot">Quick Shoot</span> is activated by doing a counter while holding left or right, then using your Weapon Action almost immediately. It shoots a bolt of lightning that hits every enemy in your small AOE range.</p>

					<b>Luster Time:</b> This activates your Photon Cluster, gives you a 30% damage reduction on incoming damage, and 200% PP gain for a limited time.

					<p><img src="images/BrandExtension.png">Brand Extension -> <span data-translate="Quick Slash">Quick Slash</span> (<span data-translate="Stay Art">Stay Art</span>) -> Enhanced Normal Attack -> <img src="images/Flechette.png">Flechette -> <img src="images/Flechette.png">Enhanced Flechette -> <img src="images/Flechette.png">Enhanced Flechette -> <span data-translate="Quick Shoot">Quick Shoot</span> -> Backwards <span data-translate="Quick Slash">Quick Slash</span> -> Enhanced Normal -> Repeat</p>
					<p>Holy crap. If you want to main Luster and feel very confident in your timing of things, feel free to use this combo. It is <b>very strict</b> in timings. However, this combo is essentially infinite PP and Gear Rotation. You can also swap in Brand Extension instead of Flechette if you want less strict timings.

					<u><h4>Baran Style</h4></u>
					<p>Since most things don't generate gear, the combo for Baran is just Enhanced Normal -> 4 Normal Attacks -> <span data-translate="Quick Shoot">Quick Shoot</span>. You can also do the Fletchette combo from Fomel.</p>

					<h4>Skill Tree/Skills</h4>
					<p>A typical Luster skill tree <a href="https://arks-layer.com/skillsim/skillcalc.php?20dIbRIobRIobRIobRIobRIobRIobRIobRIobRIobRIobRIobRIobRIo0jdodBdo006dBdBIb00000006dodA00fdAdBIo000000jdoIbIb00dAdBIo000000jdoIb00dBdBIb000000dB006dBdBIb0000008dBIn00jdndBdB0000009bIoIo07bfdBdB000000doIbIo00dBdBIb000000jdB00dndBdB000006dBIo9b8dAIoIb000006dAdBdodAIoibdndn0000000fdAdBdodBindnib0000000fdBdBeBdBdBmodKJedKJbdKdDdBdBdBdBdBdBdBdBIb000000000">can be found here</A>. It's a base tree - Feel free to change the points in <span data-translate="Voltage Reset Heal">Voltage Reset Heal</span> and Complete Rest as you want.. Remember that percentage multipliers are always better than straight additions, so a 5% increase to something will almost always be better than doing +5 to it.</p>
					<h4>Rings</h4>
					<h5>Left Rings</h5>
					<ul>
					<li><img src="images/64px-UIItemNearbyAutoTarget.png" width="32" height="32"><b><span data-translate="Mate Maniac">Mate Maniac</span></b>: Speeds up the consumption animation of -mate items.
					<li><img src="images/64px-UIItemAtomizerFanatic.png" width="32" height="32"><b><span data-translate="Atomizer Fanatic">Atomizer Fanatic</span></b>: Speeds up the consumption animation of Moon/Sol/Star Atomizers and increases their recovery rate.
					<li><img src="images/64px-UIItemQuickIllusion.png" width="32" height="32"><b><span data-translate="Party Toughness">Party Toughness</span></b>: Reduces damage taken based on the number of players in your Party. Does nothing if you're solo.
					<li><img src="images/64px-UIItemTimeAfterTimePreserve.png" width="32" height="32"><b><span data-translate="Leaping Dodge">Leaping Dodge</span></b>: Gives you a active skill that lets you jump super high. 
					<li><img src="images/64px-UIItemQuickIllusion.png" width="32" height="32"><b><span data-translate="Mag Excitement">Mag Excitement</span></b>: Increases the power of your Mag's Auto Action and reduces its cooldown.
					</ul>
					<p>You can slot 3 of these into units, then just wear the last one as a normal ring.</p>
					<h5>Right Rings</h5>
					<ul>
					<li><img src="images/64px-UIItemAdrenaline.png" width="32" height="32"><b><span data-translate="Critical Strike">Critical Strike</span> (Combo Ring)</b>: Increases your crit power for all 3 attack stats by 3% and your crit rate for all 3 stats by 20% (at level 20)
					</ul>
					<h4>Mag</h4>
					<p>Your Mag's total attack stats (Melee, Range, and Tech) are added up and then distributed evenly to all three stats - So it doesn't matter which kind of attack mag you're using (as long as it has all it's points in attack!).</p>
					<h4>Movement skill</h4>
					<p>Luster can use <img src="images/Flechette.png"><b>Flechette</b> to move rapidly as opposed to just running. Gotta go fast!</p>
