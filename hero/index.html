						<h3 class="boldtitlelarge mr-auto"><a id="intro"></a>Introduction to Hero</h3>
					</div><br>
					<p><img src="images/hero_class.png">Hero is the first <span data-translate="scion">scion</span> class released for PSO2. It requires you to have two classes at 75+, and unlocks the ability to become a Hero on any character. Hero differs from most classes as it cannot take a subclass or be used as a subclass. It uses Swords, Twin Machine Guns, and Talises as it's main weapons. <i>However</i>, it uses them in all new and creative ways. Let's go over them real quick.
					<br><br>
					
					<img src="images/sword.png"><b>Sword</b>: Sword is generally the same (you swing it, but with one hand now!), but actions are much faster. Your sword weapon action fires a blast from your hand that can be charged up (and adds AOE damage).
					<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ovze1YXrm5c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</div><br>
					<img src="images/tmg.png"><b>Twin Machine Gun</b>: Your normal attack and PAs both use PP. However, your weapon action skill generates PP insanely fast as you hold it down (faster if you <span data-translate="Perfect Attack">Perfect Attack</span> it). You can also step (hit the dodge button) and hit a <span data-translate="Perfect Attack">Perfect Attack</span> reload repeatedly to build it slightly faster. The later would be useful, for example, in combat situations where you need to dodge a lot.
					<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/anU2xIxEvLc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</div><br>
					<img src="images/talis.png"><b>Talis</b>: Instead of casting techs with them, you throw the <strike>Yu-Gi-Oh cards from your duel deck</strike> talis and hit <strike>the enemy's life points directly</strike> enemies with it. Your weapon action lets you warp quickly in any direction. If you hold down the weapon action button, you can release it to throw the talis and have it stay, then hit the weapon action button again to warp to it.<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ram0bLdgAQo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</div><br>If you hold the weapon action, you can throw the talis, then tap the weapon action button again to teleport to where it was thrown.
					<br>
					<br>
					The Hero class can also use techniques! Hero's PAs are also much simpler than the original classes - You have them all at the start, and they cannot be leveled up or crafted. No more hunting down level 17 disks!
					<br><br>
					Hero's main focus is kind of like playing a Devil May Cry or a Bayonetta game - You want to mix up your PAs and combos to increase your <span data-translate="focus">focus</span>, as doing the same move over and over will build it much more slowly. You also want to avoid getting hit, as taking more than 20% of your HP in damage will reset <span data-translate="Heroic Boost">Heroic Boost</span>, which can be stacked up to a 80% attack boost. In order to do this, we'll need to learn the basic combos for each weapon first.</p>
					<!-- Basic Combos -->
					<div class="mr-auto w-50">
						<h3 class="boldtitlelarge mr-auto"><a id="basiccombos"></a>Basic Combos</h3>
					</div><br>
					<h4>Sword Combo 1</h4>
					<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5u0WlmluiwM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</div><br>
					<p><img src="images/UIPhotonArtRisingSlash.png">Rising Slash (The full combo, so throw -> slash -> slam) twice -> Normal Attack (This will do the third part of the normal attack) -> Repeat</p>
					<p>This is your "boss that loves to stand still" combo. You <i>could</i> just hold down Rising Slash, but that does less damage and generates a lot less gear, so it's a bad idea (and is the trademark thing that people who don't know how to play Hero do!)</p>
					<br>
					<h4>Sword Combo 2</h4>
					<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6h2WltGF8BE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</div><br>
					<p><img src="images/UIPhotonArtBulletblitz.png"><span data-translate="Bulletblitz">Bulletblitz</span> twice -> Normal Attack -> Repeat</p>
					<p>This is your combo for things that are moving constantly until they sit in place so you can smack them with the first combo.</p>
					<br>
					<h4>Twin Machine Gun</h4>
					<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ouxFUD9cRiQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</div><br>
					<p>Use <img src="images/UIPhotonArtSleightshotGambit.png"><span data-translate="Sleightshot Gambit">Sleightshot Gambit</span>. That's literally it.</p>
					<p>Always be on the lookout for moments of downtime where you can reload to gain tons of PP back.</p>
					<br>
					<h4>Talis</h4>
					<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kGRLuEjkR_0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</div><br>
					<p><img src="images/UIPhotonArtEdgeracerGambit.png"><span data-translate="Edgeracer Gambit">Edgeracer Gambit</span> twice -> Normal Attack (3rd part). <img src="images/UIPhotonArtHoundblade.png"><span data-translate="Houndblade">Houndblade</span> is a <b>D</b>amage <b>O</b>ver <b>T</b>ime skill - You'll want to substitute it for <span data-translate="Edgeracer Gambit">Edgeracer Gambit</span> whenever it stop hurting the enemy. For example, if we notice it falls off, we'd do <span data-translate="Houndblade">Houndblade</span> -> <span data-translate="Edgeracer Gambit">Edgeracer Gambit</span> once -> Normal Attack (3rd part), then go back to the Normal <span data-translate="Edgeracer Gambit">Edgeracer Gambit</span> twice -> Normal Attack (3rd part) until it falls off again. (As shown in the video above)</p>
					<p>Make sure you're applying <span data-translate="Houndblade">Houndblade</span> whenever possible - It provides very useful extra damage and builds Hero time quite quickly. The damage of <span data-translate="Houndblade">Houndblade</span> changes based on the current weapon's main attack power - If your sword/TMG are more powerful than your talis, put the DoT on the enemy and then switch to a weapon with higher attack to do more damage with it. You shouldn't bother putting <span data-translate="Houndblade">Houndblade</span> on an enemy with low HP, though.</p>
					<div class="mr-auto w-50">
						<h3 class="boldtitlelarge mr-auto"><a id="midcombat"></a>Swapping Midcombat</h3>
					</div><br>
					<p>By using certain PAs, you can optionally swap weapons midcombat (much faster than swapping them manually!). PAs that do this have a small <img src="images/UIPhotonArtEdgeracerGambit.png">red, <img src="images/UIPhotonArtSleightshotGambit.png">yellow, or <img src="images/UIPhotonArtBulletblitz.png">blue icon on them. Red means they swap to sword, yellow means talis, and blue means TMG. They will swap to the <i>first</i> weapon of that type, starting from the top of your weapon pallete, if you hold down the PA button while using it. You can still use the PA and not swap, just don't hold down the PA button. </p>
					<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jQVlzqci0cE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</div><br>
					<div class="mr-auto w-50">
						<h3 class="boldtitlelarge mr-auto"><a id="buildingfocus"></a>Counters/Building <span data-translate="Focus">Focus</span></h3>
					</div><br>
					<p>Hero also has a unique mechanic - Counters! It essentially has the same timing as Braver counter and Perfect Guarding, but you dodge instead of blocking. Dodging an attack at the right moment makes a unique noise, and lets you press the normal attack button to do a damaging counterattack. Countering also greatly increases your Heroic boost percent (but not beyond its max).</p>
					<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9qqPhW1jZoU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</div><br>
					<p>For TMGs, there is a special PA called <img src="images/UIPhotonArtStarfireSquall.png"><span data-translate="Starfire Squall">Starfire Squall</span> that increases it's damage exponentially if used as a counterattack. It does significantly more damage than the sword counter and is something to seriously consider doing if you're fighting an enemy that you know you will be countering often (soloing bosses, for example).</p>
					<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9KZR-0V1rlE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</div><br>
					<p>Please keep in mind that my TMGs (1819 ATK) are significantly weaker than my Sword (2569 ATK), and yet the damage with the TMG Counter + <span data-translate="Starfire Squall">Starfire Squall</span> is much higher still. Assuming that all hits are crits on both weapons, we have 262,000 damage with sword counter, versus 40,000*12 (480,000) to 40,000*16 (640,000) with TMG. It's pretty crazy.</p>
					<p>Countering also increases your <span data-translate="Heroic Boost">Heroic Boost</span> percent (but not beyond its max) and increases your <span data-translate="focus">focus</span>, which brings us to another important part of Hero - building <span data-translate="focus">focus</span>!</p>
					<br>
					<p>Your main objective as a Hero (while looking cool and stylish) is to build <span data-translate="focus">focus</span> for your Hero Time by countering, avoiding damage, and using different skills. There is a gauge at the center of your subpallete, and once it fills you can activate <b>HERO TIME</b>!
					<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G8L2BvwDW_c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</div><br>
					Once activated, your power increases by the number of hits you do while it is active (big brain strat is to use TMG's <span data-translate="Sleightshot Gambit">Sleightshot Gambit</span> PA twice to max it, then switch back to Sword). Your PP is also fully restored. Press it again (once your Hero Time is about to run out) to do a Hero Time Finish, whose gigantic damage is based upon how many hits you did and what weapon (Sword, TMG, or Talis) you have out when you activate it. You are also invulnerable during the Hero Time Finish.</p>
					<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FcU915bWIYU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</div><br>
					<p>You can also use half of your gauge to activate Hero Refresh - This consumes half of your gauge to recover HP, PP, and reset Hero Will. You cannot do a Hero Time Finish when you use Hero Refresh.</p><br>
					<div class="mr-auto w-50">
						<h3 class="boldtitlelarge mr-auto"><a id="jumpcancel"></a>Jump Cancelling</h3>
					</div><br>
					<p>Jump cancelling is the process of letting you use Sword and TMG PAs much faster than normal. In the combo videos above, you see me do the attacks normally. However, if we put jump cancelling into the process for TMGs, for example:</p>
					<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e6LP4pNK7Yk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</div><br>
					<p>You can fit a lot more PAs into the same time window. Jump cancelling is also semi-dependent on the Hero skill "<span data-translate="Hero Encore Jump">Hero Encore Jump</span>", so that you can do jump cancels over and over by jumping off the enemy. You can also cancel the 3rd sword normal with a jump, instead of waiting for the <span data-translate="Perfect Attack">Perfect Attack</span> window, and let the Hero skill "First Blood" take care of empowering the next PA. It's much faster than waiting for the <span data-translate="Perfect Attack">Perfect Attack</span> window.
					<br><br>
					You can also jump cancel from afar by barely jumping, using a TMG PA, then repeating this process, as seen below:</p>
					<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xpdBWsZa-z8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</div><br>
					<div class="mr-auto w-50">
						<h3 class="boldtitlelarge mr-auto"><a id="otherthings"></a>Other Information</h3>
					</div><br>
					<h4>Mobbing</h4>
					<p>If someone (you?) casts Zondeel (or someone uses the Nifta mag), you can Rising Slash entire groups of enemies all at once. If not, then you should use <span data-translate="Brightblade Buster">Brightblade Buster</span> (Sword) for all your AOE. You can also just use sword normals if low damage will kill them, since the normal attacks on sword have some range. You could also use Final Storm (TMG), but the AOE is much smaller (but can be more powerful if you manage to get headshots on everything).</p>
					<h4>Skill Tree</h4>
					<p>A typical Hero skill tree can be found by checking <a href="https://arks-layer.com/classbuildsna/">the PSO2NA Class Builds Compilation</a>. Remember that percentage multipliers are always better than straight additions, so a 5% increase to something will almost always be better than doing +5 to it.</p>
					<h4>Skills</h4>
					<p>Hero has some skills that every Hero should be using and have on their subpallete.</p>
					<ul>
					<li><img src="images/UISkillHrHeroBoost.png"><b><span data-translate="Heroic Boost">Heroic Boost</span></b>: At max level, this increases the damage you deal by 1% per second of not taking damage, up to <span data-translate="60%">60%</span>.</li>
					<li><img src="images/UISkillHrHeroCounter.png"><b>Hero Counter</b>: Dodging an attack at the right moment makes a unique noise, and lets you press the attack button to do a damaging counterattack. This also increases your Heroic boost percent (but not beyond its max).</li>
					<li><img src="images/UISkillHrHeroGearHeroTime.png"><b>Hero Time</b>: You activate this skill when your <span data-translate="focus">focus</span> is maxed, and your power increases by the number of hits you do while it is active (big brain strat is to use TMG's Sleightshot Gambit PA twice to max it, then switch back to sword). Your PP is also fully restored. Press it again to do a Hero Time Finish, whose gigantic damage is based upon how many hits you did and what weapon you have out when you activate it. You are also invulnerable during the Hero Time Finish.</li>
					<li><img src="images/UISkillHrHeroWill.png"><b>Hero Will</b>: When something would kill you, it doesn't. Simple, yet awesome. Only works once per quest unless reset by Hero Refresh.
					<li><img src="images/skill_hr_refresh.png"><b>Hero Refresh</b>: Similar to Hero time, but consumes half of your gauge to recover HP, PP, and reset Hero Will. Cannot be used to do Hero Time Finish.</li>
					<li><img src="images/UISkillHrVictoryShout.png"><b>Victory Shout</b>: Recovers PP based on the number of enemies around you. Also increases your threat level (aggro), very useful for making enemies attack you instead of towers or other defensible objects.</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Rings</h4>
					<h5>Left Rings</h5>
					<ul>
					<li><img src="images/64px-UIItemAtomizerFanatic.png" width="32" height="32"><b><span data-translate="Atomizer Fanatic">Atomizer Fanatic</span></b>: Speeds up the consumption animation of Moon/Sol/Star Atomizers and increases their recovery rate.
					<li><img src="images/64px-UIItemQuickIllusion.png" width="32" height="32"><b><span data-translate="Party Toughness">Party Toughness</span></b>: Reduces damage taken based on the number of players in your Party. Does nothing if you're solo.
					<li><img src="images/64px-UIItemTimeAfterTimePreserve.png" width="32" height="32"><b><span data-translate="Leaping Dodge">Leaping Dodge</span></b>: Gives you a active skill that lets you jump super high. 
					<li><img src="images/64px-UIItemQuickIllusion.png" width="32" height="32"><b><span data-translate="Mag Excitement">Mag Excitement</span></b>: Increases the power of your Mag's Auto Action and reduces its cooldown.
					</ul>
					<p>You can slot 3 of these into units, then just wear the last one as a normal ring.</p>
					<h5>Right Rings</h5>
					<ul>
					<li><img src="images/64px-UIItemPerfectionist.png" width="32" height="32"><b><span data-translate="Perfectionist">Perfectionist</span> (Combo Ring)</b>: Gives an extra 3% damage to all 3 attack stats while you remain over 75% healed (at level 20)
					<li><img src="images/64px-UIItemAdrenaline.png" width="32" height="32"><b><span data-translate="Critical Strike">Critical Strike</span> (Combo Ring)</b>: Increases your crit power for all 3 attack stats by 3% and your crit rate for all 3 stats by 20% (at level 20)
					<!--<li><img src="images/64px-UIItemEffortSymbolHu.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Effort Symbol</b>: Increases damage by 1%, critical hit rate by 10%, and makes you take 3% less damage. The important part is that you get it by doing a relatively "hard" extreme quest (flex), and it shows a visual effect when you wear it. (Not currently available in NA)-->
					</ul>
					<!--<p>This one is really up to you - I'd recommend perfectionist or critical but if you don't wanna combine the three rings for it, effort symbol works too (and looks cool!)</p>-->
					<p>This one is really up to you, either one works.</p>
					<h4>Techniques</h4>
					<p>Hero can use techniques, and some of them are highly recommended for certain situations.</p>
					<ul>
					<li><img src="images/UITechResta.png"><b>Resta</b>: Heals you and the people around you.</li>
					<li><img src="images/UITechMegiverse.png"><b>Megiverse</b>: Generates a field that heals anyone in it when they inflict damage on enemies.</li>
					<li><img src="images/UITechAnti.png"><b>Anti</b>: Cures status effects for you and the people around you.</li>
					<li><img src="images/UITechZondeel.png"><b>Zondeel</b>: Used to pull enemies from the surrounding area into one spot so you can kill them all at once. It's recommended that you also craft this to make its range wider.</li>
					<li><img src="images/UITechZanverse.png"><b>Zanverse</b>: Generates a field of wind around you and makes you <b>and everyone around you</b> deal bonus wind damage. Free damage!</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Mag</h4>
					<p>Your Mag's total attack stats (Melee, Range, and Tech) are added up and then distributed evenly to all three stats - So it doesn't matter which kind of attack mag you're using (as long as it has all it's points in attack!).</p>
					<h4>Affixes</h4>
					<p>Ideally, you'll want to have stat boosts in all attack types (Melee, Range, and Tech), since you'll typically be using all 3 weapons.</p>
					<h4>Movement skills</h4>
					<p>Like other classes, Hero has some skills that people can use to move rapidly as opposed to just running. Gotta go fast!</p>
					<ul>
					<li><img src="images/UIPhotonArtTrickflash.png"><span data-translate="Trickflash"><b>Trickflash</b></span> (Sword PA): Lunges forward with your sword, good for movement but doesn't change your altitude.</li>
					<li><img src="images/UITechSafoie.png"><b>Crafted Safoie /C (Technique)</b>: Moves forward but also changes your altitude so you can hit enemies in the air or weak spots above the ground level.</li>
					<li><img src="images/UITechIlzonde.png"><b>Ilzonde (Technique)</b>: Moves forward and through enemies, does not change altitude.</li>
					</ul>					
					<h4>Why do some people SPEAK IN ALL CAPS WHEN TALKING ABOUT HERO?</h4>

						<h3 class="boldtitlelarge mr-auto"><a id="keepinmind"></a>Gameplay Tips</h3>
					</div><br>
					<ul>
					<li>Keep an eye out for downtime opportunities/when bosses turn invuln, so you can use TMG Reload to get your PP back fast or precharge a weapon action.</li>
					<li><b>If there's no <span data-translate="techter">techter</span> in the party</b>, casting a Zanverse before using Hero Time Finish is a good idea (if possible).</li>
					<li>Remember to take advantage of Hero Time and Hero Refresh, as well as executing Hero Finish while <span data-translate="Heroic Boost">Heroic Boost</span> and Hero Time’s attack bonus are at their peak.</li>
					<li>Always seek Hero Counter opportunities to deal high damage while evading attacks.</li>
